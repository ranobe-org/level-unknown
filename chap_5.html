<p>Boranth Corp. had me for way over 5 years now, I brought so much prestige to the company
I worked so hard for the company and its business, and now it is the biggest company in the market.
But it is kinda sad that very few actually know about us, the hidden offices, hidden transactions, it
is very hard to get hold of us. Just a few members of the board know how exactly the company functions.</p>
<p>It was just any other day for me, waking up early making hot coffee and getting ready for the office. As
always I went to the bathroom to freshen up and look in the mirror. I saw something unusual today, there
was something, some number right above my head, it is like a name tag. It is red and dancing right above
my head, the number is 202. I ignore it and go to my office while driving, I'm seeing this number on
everyone's head, it is weird it is like a name tag, not like a number tag on vehicles. More like a designation,
maybe the number represents the higher you are in society.</p>
<p>I am just at 202, which is sad, there are other people with numbers like 100, 120, 121, 32, etc. There
are children on the side of the road with 180, 192, etc. skills, even children are at a higher level than other
humans. I arrive at my office, there is some fight going on with the staff members, the head Mr Nino is
shouting at his colleagues, his skill is 120, he seems very angry. Just when I was about to get into the
elevator, he hit one of his colleagues, and there I see it! his skill now is 118, did he just lose 2 points,
maybe cause he hit him? Can it be possible?</p>
<p>What is the use of this skill though? The more I think about it the more I get it, people with higher skill
point are actually managers and department heads, they are getting respected by others, and maybe since their
skill point is higher they are getting respected even more. Does it affect only the people we know or
every other person? I believe it should work on everyone cause you possess higher skill points than others.
I think I should work on improving my skill point and then I can gain respect from everyone.</p>
<p>It's another of those meetings today, where we have to discuss the unwanted way to put end to someone, or I
should say put someone down when they don't follow the advice we give them. Mr Nakashi, head of business,
is the person who will be handling this job, it's their first time. And I see that he is not so skilful too.
His skill point is just 50, and he is about the put down this person who owns a shop in the city. I have his
photo in my hand, and I see his skill too, it's 120, very high indeed. He must be a good person but in our case,
he is not. We decided to put an end to his life today, it was the decision of the board, and no decisions go
out of the board, so we can remain clean.</p>
<p>The result of the meeting will be announced today itself, right in the evening before we end the day. I have been
working so long in the company, but they never delay the results, and the cruelty and punctuality of the
organization are always on point. The board members are a highly intelligent species in themselves, you could
classify them as the next Einstein or even compare them with serial killers, at last, they are murders and so am
I, but to get where I am standing you have to drop some blood. And the blood which was spilt today has
finally arrived, the mission or I should say the task was successful Mr Nakashi got it done as expected and fairly
clean considering it was his first job.</p>
<p>Mr Nakashi entered the meeting room just like a hero, the room is filled with a round of applause, he certainly
deserves it, wait I minute! I recall that Nakashi had a skill of 50, but now it is 170, could it be that
50 plus 120, after the murder, 170.</p>
<p>If the person did something bad but end up killing them, receive their skill, it is that simple. It means
Nakashi gain the skill from the victim, the respect everyone is giving, is it why? So If I kill Nakashi could become
202 plus 170! I found the secret, I found the way to climb to the top, Azreal, the business man of the world
is going to conquer everyone and you will respect me. I will kill all of them and gain what is mine!</p>
<p>I need a plan!</p>
