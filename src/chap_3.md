## Tragic Accident or Good thing?

I woke up early today even though its Sunday, I have to go to the Arcade, some kid broke by high score, he probably
slept in the arcade as well. I have to put up another big score, can't let anyone else take my place. I can't wait,
I will run there and get it sorted. 

Today is different in some way, the sky is clear and sun is shining with full potentials and I hate heat, I am very
prone to strokes but haven't had a one in a while. Sundays is movies day, I stay in my room whole day watching movies,
tv series, anime, and read some novels. I am not that lazy but there is nothing else to do on sundays, it is the 
only day on my calendar which is empty with room for all fun things, and today its empty for pacman. 

There is unusual walking traffic on the sideways, it's time to take a shortcut, there is only one shortcut right 
under the bridge through the undergrounds ways. I hardly travel underground, but I know it all I spent so much time
in the city that I know which road leads to what not only that, but I also know where are houses of some celebrities 
and notorious business person. They have big houses, huge properties and fancy cars. I would like to get a car some day, 
It would have been great if pacman players would get paid. Yeah, that will be something. 

The underground was just ahead, It was all sunny throughout the walk, I walked around the road and started climbing down
the set of stairs, the stairs are usually kept clean, and they were quite clean today. The stairs were wet I read the
sign and slowed down, but I lost control couldn't stop, I won't stop, too late now going to fall and brake a bone for 
sure. Someone save me! 

_"Yes he fell right on his head!"_

Jumal how are you feeling? I hear this voice in my head, it is throbbing with pain, my head hurts like I just fall
down the stairs. Yes I fell down that stairway, but it wasn't that deadly, I can't open my eyes. I have to try
harder. Where am I? Is this a hospital? I am in a hospital, this is the nurse, I have been unconscious for 15hours.
The hospital has informed my family but no one arrived, that's strange how can no one come visit me? 

I can't believe I fell from the stairs and ended up here, how am I going to pay for the bills, this is so bad, the nurse
is still here looking through the report, and its multiple pages, what are these people cooking? I can tell them
I'm a law student they might not charge me extra. Wait a minute! Am I hallucinating? What is it that I'm seeing on the 
nurse's head, is that a ... that can't be right.

I asked the nurse if I'm on any medicines, any stronger ones, she replied saying I'm on morphine. Morphine is for pain
right, why would I be hallucinating. The doctor came in, I see it clearly, it is number, a numerical figure right on
top of their heads like scores in a video game, and its red, and they are not solid but floating like animals. Am
I gone mad? This is not something ordinary, it's weird. The doctor asked me how I was doing and told me that I can 
leave in the evening or tomorrow if I want to stay longer. 

I don't care anymore if I stay here or go out, the only thing that is bothering me is this number on people's head, it 
was on the nurse's head and the doctor's and the other nurse which came in the morning. Wait a minute, I need to see
a mirror, there is a bathroom, there should be a mirror. I walked inside the bathroom and there was a small mirror 
enough to see my face. My head was bandaged tightly and spot of blood where I probably hit myself in the head. I 
raised my eyes to look just above my head, and I saw it. 

I saw that I have nothing like what I saw on other people. I can't see it, where is my number, this is 
more weird than seeing numbers on top of people' head. May be it cause of the bandage, may be my number is stuck inside.
That's stupid, may be these medicines did affect me, and now I am probably no more in the effect. I should go out and visit
other rooms to see if I still see it. 

No matter I can see it now or not, but it is real fascinating that something like this happen, the number was like a score
no no more like level, or could be years for how long they live. That's not possible if that was year the doctor would be 
living for 98 more years. And the nurse for 65 more years. May be it can be the total years, that's possible. But the average
life span is just around 60, these people must be lucky then. Let's not waste time here, just go home watch another movie, 
go to bed. I will beat my score next sunday. Hopefully the bill is not as big as my pocket.
