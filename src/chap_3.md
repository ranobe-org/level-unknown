## Accident or a Blessing?

I woke up early today even though it's Sunday, I have to go to the Arcade, some kid broke by a high score, he probably
slept in the arcade as well. I have to put up another big score, can't let anyone else take my place. I can't wait,
I will run there and get it sorted.

Today is different in some ways, the sky is clear and the sun is shining with full potential and I hate the heat, I am very
prone to strokes but haven't had one in a while. Sundays are movies day, I stay in my room the whole day watching movies,
tv series, and anime, and reading some novels. I am not that lazy but there is nothing else to do on Sundays, it is the
only day on my calendar which is empty with room for all fun things, and today it's empty for Pacman.

There is unusual walking traffic on the sideways, it's time to take a shortcut, there is only one shortcut right
under the bridge through the ways of the underground. I hardly travel underground, but I know it all I spent so much time
in the city that I know which road leads to what not only that, but I also know where are houses of some celebrities
and notorious business person. They have big houses, huge properties and fancy cars. I would like to get a car someday,
It would have been great if Pacman players would get paid. Yeah, that will be something.

The underground was just ahead, It was all sunny throughout the walk, I walked around the road and started climbing down
the set of stairs, the stairs are usually kept clean, and they were quite clean today. The stairs were wet I read the
sign and slowed down, but I lost control and couldn't stop, I won't stop, too late now going to fall and brake a bone for
sure. Someone save me!

_"Yes he fell right on his head!"_

Jumal how are you feeling? I hear this voice in my head, it is throbbing with pain, my head hurts like I just fall
down the stairs. Yes, I fell down that stairway, but it wasn't that deadly, I can't open my eyes. I have to try
harder. Where am I? Is this a hospital? I am in a hospital, this is the nurse, I have been unconscious for 15 hours.
The hospital informed my family but no one arrived, that's strange how can no one come to visit me?

I can't believe I fell from the stairs and ended up here, how am I going to pay for the bills, this is so bad, the nurse
is still here looking through the report, and it's multiple pages, what are these people cooking? I can tell them
I'm a law student they might not charge me extra. Wait a minute! Am I hallucinating? What is it that I'm seeing on the
nurse's head, is that a ... that can't be right.

I asked the nurse if I'm on any medicines, any stronger ones, and she replied saying I'm on morphine. Morphine is for pain
right, why would I be hallucinating? The doctor came in, and I see it, it is a number, a numerical figure right on
top of their heads like scores in a video game, and its red, and they are not solid but floating like animals. Am
Have I gone mad? This is not something ordinary, it's weird. The doctor asked me how I was doing and told me that I can
leave in the evening or tomorrow if I want to stay longer.

I don't care anymore if I stay here or go out, the only thing that is bothering me is this number on people's heads, it
was on the nurse's head and the doctor's and the other nurse's which came in the morning. Wait a minute, I need to see
a mirror, there is a bathroom, there should be a mirror. I walked inside the bathroom and there was a small mirror
enough to see my face. My head was bandaged tightly and a spot of blood where I probably hit myself in the head. I
raised my eyes to look just above my head, and I saw it.

I saw that I have nothing like what I saw in other people. I can't see it, where is my number, this is
weirder than seeing numbers on top of people's heads. It's the cause of the bandage, maybe my number is stuck inside.
That's stupid, maybe these medicines did affect me, and now I am probably no more in the effect. I should go out and visit
other rooms to see if I still see it.

No matter whether I can see it now or not, it is fascinating that something like this happens, the number was like a score
no more like a level or could be years for how long they live. That's not possible if that was the year the doctor would be
living for 98 more years. And the nurse for 65 more years. Maybe it can be the total years, that's possible. But the average
life span is just around 60, these people must be lucky then. Let's not waste time here, just go home watch another movie,
and go to bed. I will beat my score next Sunday. Hopefully, the bill is not as big as my pocket.

I left the hospital but the receptionist, the doctors, the patients, and the nurse all had that number right on their heads,
I could read it so clearly that I don't think it is any hallucination anyone could ever experience. Looks like I got
extra power-ups when I fell from that stairs. I am so confused about what is happening to me. The odd thing is that I can't
see my level. Yes, I'm going to call it a level because I don't think it is the year people are going to live for. The reason
is I just saw one person with the number 135, which can only mean it is some kind of level, yes also I think he was the head
of some charity organization.

I need to figure out more about this, I am able to see levels on all of these people. There, is an old man sitting in the park feeding
the pigeons, he is on level 150, and the old lady, probably his wife with level 148. As the old lady started throwing some  
bread crumbs, something happened, something changed, yes, the level of the old lady just turned to 149, does this
mean feeding pigeons increase your level? How often does this increase? I'm sure the couple feed the pigeons every day, no way
the level changes every day. There was some noise at the end of the park, right near the sushi hotel, looks like the owner
is upset with the waiter for something, looks like the waiter drop food on a customer, and the owner is cursing and hitting this
poor waiter. Wait a minute! when I first saw the owner had level 65, now suddenly it is level 65, could this be... no way...
it is that simple, if you do good deeds you level up and if do something bad you level down!

But what does this level represents, it's just a badge, what if someone is of a high level? Well, it is getting late I should hurry
and rest, hope I don't lose this power when I wake up. I am home! long walk but what I don't get is what I'm going to do with
this weird power to see other people's level and not mine. Why not mine? Maybe, the power givers don't want me to improve my level.
But I can increase my level by just doing something good, any good deed with surely reward me +1 level. It could be possible
that I'm already at a very high level, I never did anything bad all I thought was of good things. I can't sleep like this, let's
watch some T.V. before I sleep.

T.V. is no exception, I can still see digital levels, yup everyone has it. I have a reality show, 'The Life', on right now. All
the characters have levels around 50-140, the average is quite bad considering the old couple had a good level. Even the waiter
was good enough. There is one person in this show, who has a good level of 170, this might be the highest I've seen yet. He
is respected by all the other members, but he doesn't come up on the video often, he is very shy. This show will probably get
rid of him since he won't provide much content. No matter what he does, everyone still loves him and respects him, talks nicely,
and listens to him. He is more like a leader to them, but he is hardly a leadership figure.

Wait, I stood quickly ran to my computer, turned it on, opened the internet browser, and searched for Mr Borth, he is an actor,
and I saw it. Then I searched for Mrs Uni, a political person, and there it was. I again searched for Juyo Anuyai a writer
and social figure, and there it was. All of them had a level greater than Level 300. This only means one thing, this is incredible,
it means 'The higher the level you are the more you will be respected in society!'.
