## God lived here

I'm Jumal, a law student, living in the city of Cardona, just an ordinary person living in the most ordinary
city on the planet, nothing ever happens here, everything here is so normal that even if someone on the 
neighbourhood decides visit the doctor it becomes news. People tend to live normal lives
with a day job and small family of two-three and a small pet mostly a cat. I lived alone leaving my house for
college hoping that it helps me focus more on my studies considering how tough is getting a law degree in the country.

I live in the north side of the city which is less crowded, I was able to rent a place with two rooms enough for
my living and study, also it was the nearest place from my college which I try to attend often than I require
to do so. Life of a student is hard in the cities considering the amount of pressure the family has and the 
amount of daily work a person has to do. It's difficult to digest that a 19-year-old has to study at least 12 hours
to get a good living and education. 

My life at my home was amazing, mom used to make meals, dad used to play video games with me, and now it's all changed.
I don't even have time to visit them that often. My schedule for the day is very tight and there's very little 
time I can put into doing something that I never planned. 

May 31, Today is the day to get admit into the next semester, there's this process of submitting fresh
documents and filling up forms at the college management office, just to get admitted to the next semester. Sounds
so silly that I am student of the college studying for entire year, but I still need to submit documents proving
that I belong to this college and my identity is what I say. Well, the process is not so long but the 
line today is. There are two people ahead of me, I know one of them, Asayi, head of Class 10, and son of the
Mayor, very arrogant but probably the most intelligent boy in the city. 

The line moved, it was Asayi's turn to submit the documents, he holds a huge file with multiple papers, I think most 
of them will be certificates from contests he won at. He submitted the docs, I was getting ready for my turn when
the clerk spoke saying that the docs were wrong, I paid attention and started checking my bunch of papers, I never
made any mistakes, may be the format changed this year. Clerk clarified that the identity document had wrong
address and the one that shows income had wrong details too, he didn't want to accept the form and ordered
to correct these details. Asayi got mad he didn't want others to know that the income doc he presented is 
actually faked, so they can get around taxation. Rich people often try to hide the fact that they are rich by making
fake documents. The clerk wouldn't accept such document, Asayi started arguing with no outcome.

Just then Asayi took out his wallet from the back pocket of his pants, a leather black wallet, filled with green notes, 
my first thought this might be the semester fees, but it wasn't he took out a bundle of it out and I knew he wasn't 
paying his fees but was bribing the management to accept his fake documents. I believe in the management to 
not allow such behaviour I'm sure now they will punish Asayi for such a stunt, but to a shock they
accepted it, not only that, but they also accepted the form and allowed this person to next semester, I hate
people who accept bribe that too in an institute who is teaching that bribery is a crime. I will report this to the
government, no to the media. But it will never get out I'm sure of it. The world is so corrupt everyone is so 
cruel, no one wants to follow the rules, no one is disciplined. I am going to work day and night to sort this out
I am going to get a law degree and punish all these people no matter what their status is, they all will 
be punished by me.

Snap out of it Jumal, you are not very good at law either, that's true said my inner voice, I was supposed to finish
my education this year, but I failed twice already and still has another year to complete, I am so determined to be
a lawyer but can't even get good marks in the most basic subjects. Why is it so hard to get marks? I'm good at 
understanding criminal cases but not that good at explaining them. I try to solve cases that are pending with some
clues here and there I have derived solutions but what use if I can't even get good marks to pass and get a real judge
to judge them.

Another day gone, nothing is learned, only frustration of people and the way the world is revolving around the sun
everyone wants to take shortcuts. Asayi bribing the management, the management accepting the fees, altering the 
records, government accepting illegal documents, mayor himself building fake trails of success, and so on. The 
world needs a cleansing, it needs a rule sets, it needs someone who can tell exactly which person is doing good and
who is committing bad things. There should be a number system, if the person does a good deed their level increases
just like my high score on the pacman game in the Bard Arcade, if person does bad he loses his life. I'm a gamer too 
but only for pacman, this game drives me nuts when someone beats my score, so I spent way too much time on it 
during nighttime. Currently, I have the highest score, and it is displayed on the board of the Arcade, Jumal #1 with
score 4500000, unbeaten since, 2 years.

One day, Im going to finish my law degree and create cases to rule out all the criminals I have collected over the 
years. I will make them guilty in the court and in the eyes of the law and make the world a good living place.
