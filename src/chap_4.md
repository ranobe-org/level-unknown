## The world waits for him

Are there other people who can see this kind of level? Are there people who fell off stairs then gained
such incredible amount of power. Honestly I don't get it, how something like this can be said of a
power it doesn't allow you to fly, nor does it help you to get xray eyes. That is something of sort of
power someone would expect to get in an extraordinary circumstance. 

I always want to get some power of my own, but now that I have one of them, which is not only weird and
unhelpful, it is the most useless power of all. I can't fly, nor can I laser to people, nor can I throw webs. 
It's completely useless and I don't like it even If I can tell if someone is a good person just by
looking at their level. Also, I cannot prove if someone is really doing well to the society or is just
acting to be good person. And yes the level of someone acting to be good is really high. I just saw someone
who is not a good person and know that for a fact has a level 150 which seems like he might be a good 
person in not really the good one. He is respected among all the members of the club he is in. Even if he is
around me. I tend to respect him, but he is not really a good person.

May be, some people get good level even if they don't do the right thing but still end up with higher levels,
this' are the people the world should be scared of, they seem normal more like likeable but end up being the 
evilest person on the planet. You would hate them in the most general form, but end up loving them, just
case they seem so lovely in the meantime, and you left a soul right a foot, you found them so friendly,
you end up trusting the soul of dark and rotten.

May be that is why I'm able to see exactly who is trying to be good and who is actually being the bad person 
among the society. These people who pretend to be good by just doing a very small amount of good in contrast to 
what creulty they do when  no one is looking at them, is much more affecting their level than the amount of 
good they do. The people don't reliaze that good deeds tend to live more than what the bad deeds live.
Bad deed is of evil, it stays long time, it rots, and stinks in the sould of good and dedad, and rots till it has 
no meaning, the world need to cleansen, the world needs to sort all the evil then only can it survive.

The world I see now is more of in the darkside, even the levels are. The world is not doing any goood, not even
good as the old couple. They have been true to themselve and the society to keep it good and achive such a level.
I will try to do good no matter what I just want my level to be positive and higher than I think I can achieve.

The level is the only thing that will drive this  world onwards , atleast for me, cause I found the secret to long
life and good life that you have to be good to the society and evveryone else casue that is what defines you the 
world you live in and the goood you do.
