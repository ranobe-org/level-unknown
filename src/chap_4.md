## The world awaits for him

Are there other people who can see this kind of level? Are there people who fell off stairs and then gained
such an incredible amount of power? Honestly, I don't get, how something like this can be said of
power it doesn't allow you to fly, nor does it help you to get X-ray eyes. That is something of the sort of
power someone would expect to get in an extraordinary circumstance.

I always want to get some power of my own, but now that I have one of them, which is not only weird and
unhelpful, it is the most useless power of all. I can't fly, nor can I laser to people, nor can I throw webs.
It's completely useless and I don't like it even If I can tell if someone is a good person just by
looking at their level. Also, I cannot prove if someone is really doing well in society or is just
acting to be a good person. And yes the level of someone acting to be good is really high. I just saw someone
who is not a good person and know that for a fact has a level 150 which seems like he might be a good
person in not really the good one. He is respected among all the members of the club he is in. Even if he is
around me. I tend to respect him, but he is not really a good person.

Maybe, some people get good levels even if they don't do the right thing but still end up with higher levels,
These' are the people the world should be scared of, they seem normal more like likeable but end up being
the evilest person on the planet. You would hate them in the most general form, but end up loving them, just
the case they seem so lovely in the meantime, and you left a soul right afoot, you found them so friendly,
you end up trusting the soul of dark and rotten.

Maybe that is why I'm able to see exactly who is trying to be good and who is actually being the bad person
in society. These people who pretend to be good by just doing a very small amount of good in contrast to
what cruelty they do when no one is looking at them is much more affecting their level than the amount of
good they do. People don't realize that good deeds tend to live more than bad deeds live.
A bad deed is of evil, it stays a long time, it rots, and stinks, rots till it has
no meaning, the world needs to cleanse, the world needs to sort all the evil then only it can survive.

The world I see now is more of the dark side, even the levels are. The world is not doing any good, not even
good as the old couple. They have been true to themselves and society to keep it good and achieve such a level.
I will try to do well no matter what I just want my level to be positive and higher than I think I can achieve.

The level is the only thing that will drive this  world onwards, latest for me because I found the secret to long
life and good life that you have to be good to society and everyone else case that is what defines you
the world you live in and the good you do.

The world needs to change, it needs to get better, and I need to step in to make things better. I will get my law degree
and judge the people and make them pay for all the bad they have done, I will make everyone person a good person
by judging their level. I shall bring peace with all my efforts. Yes! that is what I'm going to do from now on.
I am going to focus on my studies and get my degree in no time.

From that day onwards, I was motivated to get things done, get my life straight and work to be the best lawyer the
world has ever seen. It's been two years, my exams went well. I studied so much for this, nothing will go to waste.
I can't believe that I'm living my dream and seeing it get completed when the results are in. The results are tomorrow,
I still have a day to celebrate, but I'm scared I don't want to reattend college this year too.

The results are in, and I have done it, I just didn't pass but scored highest among all the others. It is just like
I have dreamt of, myself in my school uniform, celebrating my first place in college, it's unbelievable like a dream.
But I have done it, officially I'm a lawyer, the first thing I will do is join a firm which I've been following lately,
they have an opening for a fresher and this is the opportunity I've been waiting for. I will join the firm and
start creating cases on the worst people that I can find, with the least levels. I know I can help the world get
better after putting my superpowers to use.

You better be scared of me low levelers, I shall demolish you from the face of the world! Not only the low levelers, also
the high levelers, I need to find out how exactly does the person get high level? As I mentioned earlier there are 
few people who are not good people, but they have a very good level, since I established that level is something
that reflects when you do something good. May be, their good deeds overwrite their bad ones, it could be a possibility, 
but I doubt people like this do good more than the bad things they tend to show. I hate getting into things that I can't
understand, this is driving me crazy, I can't even tell no one they will just assume I lost a screw on the stairs and
I should be put into mental hospital or something.

But I'm not mad, I see everything clearly, just like I used to, but now I have the proof, proof of level, a level of your
head resembling the amount of good or bad person you are. I take oath that I shall bring good to this world, and 
I am going to make this happen!
