## Devil isn't that far

Boranth Corp. the biggest and richest of all industries and firms on the planet but very few actually know about this
financially big organization whose whole responsibility is to keep the society functioning by providing funds to 
middle corporations and government agencies. I am the director member of the board and my only responsibility is 
to handle people who work below me, I worked so hard for this my entire life, I studied hard started working 
at a very early age. I am Azreal, businessman. I am always in search of power with full of my abilities. I handle
most of the infrastructure and banking facilities, every bank manager is my employee.

Today is just as any other day as I woke up at 4:00am, made myself a hot coffee. The sun hasn't risen yet, but some
building have lights turned on. My building is the only building in the vicinity with 50 floors that stood so high
that in rainy seasons I can see the clouds from my windows. All these small buildings around me are like peasants
to me, they stink and stay in the rotten, if even a single one could have dared and risked to become like me, 
they could have escaped from the reality, they dont have the guts, they don't want to shed some blood. 

I shed not a single drop but rivers, lakes of blood on my way to the top, I don't care of meaningless lives 
becoming obstacles in my way even if it is family, Yes, specially if it is family, cause when that happens the 
world respects you more, the more they respect you the more they fear for their life. I can teach all this peasants
how to live under me, I shall conquer this business world, I do in some extent, but I want more.

My assistant messaged me that the Aus Deal is going to be arranged for the day, I got ready as usual driving my way
to the office, I was ready for anything thrown by the Aus manager Mr. Saki, a white bearded strong man, anyone 
talking to him will lower his own voice to give this man the respect he thinks he deserves, but I know exactly
how to handle such kind of situations and I don't lower my voice not even it means a loss for the company. 

Mr. Saki agreed to provide us with the infrastructure so that the next company building could be built. It is supposed
to build in the center of Cardona city. But he had a condition, the condition was that the amount paid for the deal 
should be double of what is required. The half is the official amount for the deal and the other half is the commission. 
Saki who had nothing to do with the deal and was just a middle man, wanted so much percentage of the commission is 
bad for the deal and my company. I knew just then what I have to do, so that Mr. Saki gets us the deal and we don't have to
lose anything. I know the right medicine for this job. I have to take him down today!

The deal was done, I paid Mr. Saki with 5000M Dollars, of which half was paid by wire while the other half was paid
cash, it was clear as day that Saki was robbing us, but we have to get the deal done, and he is the only person who
can get this done. Mr. Saki and I shared a bottle of rich whiskey, he laughed like a small child, he told old stories
of how we planned to become a businessman. But he doesn't have any idea of what is about to come, what is about to happen
to the child like laugh of his? No one is going to hear from him the next day. You will regret this meet Saki, you 
are going to pay for the loss with your useless life. So Saki left with a happy face, and  I can't wait to see his red
one in the newspapers.

I don't commit murder, I just order them, my assassin X is ordered to kill Mr. Saki by a road accident so no one
suspects us, it will be just like a tragedy. Oh poor Saki, you will pay for the loss you cause to the company. X will
not only put you down but will fetch all the money back, so you can lose only one thing, your life.

My secretary, Ash, a blonde with blue eyes, walked in, she was explaining me, how Mr. Saki dies of accident, how the money 
bag disappeared? and how this all can be bad for the deal? I was very happy from the results, and unknowingly I burst 
saying he got what he deserves and of course it was planned. The secretary was shocked her eyes wide open, 
her face slowly turning pale, she was silent for a minute or more and burst out of the room apologizing for bringing 
the news. 

This was a mistake I can not let something like this small distract me from making a mistake in the public, no one 
should know about this. Even though I didn't say much, but it did reveal my intentions and I can be found guilty. 
Guilty of a murder which I technically did not commit, or did I? who cares. I could call her, tell her what I meant
or could let her know that I did but for a reason. That will be foolish, there's no going back. What if while she
travels home today by the train and accidentally fall on the tracks just when the train arrives, and her skull gets
crashed by the wheels of the train and the blood splatters around the station and everyone screaming out loud, yeah
that will be good scene!

I am back home, I usually watch some news before going to bed, and voil√†, a woman falls on the track of Nasro Station
this evening 7pm, was it a suicide? was it an accident? no one knows. Isn't that exactly what I predicted this afternoon,
yes I did and in such details. Ha ha, the life of a human being is so fragile even a small decision can make you lose
your pathetic life. Life is just a meaningless joke which can end just by the smallest decision possible. Only the 
god knows how long you live, or only I know how long you can live for. I am the angel of death, Azreal! bow before me!
