<p>Jumal, a school boy realizes he is now able to see levels of people right above their heads, its unreal but at the same time feels 
much real, with little to no understanding of how he possesses this great power he explores the world in search of knowledge and strength.</p>
<p>The only flaw of his great powers is that he can not see his own level which is going to drive him mad until he realizes that someone might
have the same powers, but this person whoever this is not an ordinary person, their intentions are cruel and disastrous filled with 
anger and revenge, lust of power and Jumal a law student knows exactly how to get this person to his knees and surrender in the hands
of law.</p>

<h2 id="god-lived-here"><a class="header" href="#god-lived-here">God lived here</a></h2>
<p>I'm Jumal, a law student, living in the city of Cardona, just an ordinary person living in the most ordinary
city on the planet, nothing ever happens here, everything here is so normal that even if someone in the
neighbourhood decides to visit the doctor it becomes news. People tend to live normal lives
with a day job and small families of two-three and a small pet mostly a cat. I lived alone leaving my house for
college hoping that it helps me focus more on my studies considering how tough is to get a law degree in the country.</p>
<p>I live on the north side of the city which is less crowded, I was able to rent a place with two rooms enough for
my living and study, also it was the nearest place to my college which I try to attend more often than I require
to do so. The life of a student is hard in the cities considering the amount of pressure the family has and the
amount of daily work a person has to do. It's difficult to digest that a 19-year-old has to study at least 12 hours
to get a good living and education.</p>
<p>My life at my home was amazing, mom used to make meals, dad used to play video games with me, and now it's all changed.
I don't even have time to visit them that often. My schedule for the day is very tight and there's very little
time I can put into doing something that I never planned.</p>
<p>May 31, Today is the day to get admitted into the next semester, there's this process of submitting fresh
documents and filling up forms at the college management office, just to get admitted to the next semester. Sounds
so silly that I am a student of the college studying for an entire year, but I still need to submit documents proving
that I belong to this college and my identity is what I say. Well, the process is not so long but the
line today is. There are two people ahead of me, I know one of them, Asayi, head of Class 10, and son of the
Mayor, is very arrogant but probably the most intelligent boy in the city.</p>
<p>The line moved, and it was Asayi's turn to submit the documents, he holds a huge file with multiple papers, I think most
of them will be certificates from contests he won at. He submitted the docs, and I was getting ready for my turn when
the clerk spoke saying that the docs were wrong, I paid attention and started checking my bunch of papers, I never
made any mistakes, and maybe the format changed this year. The clerk clarified that the identity document had the wrong
address and the one that shows income had the wrong details too, he didn't want to accept the form and ordered
to correct these details. Asayi got mad he didn't want others to know that the income doc he presented is
faked, so they can get around taxation. Rich people often try to hide the fact that they are rich by making
fake documents. The clerk wouldn't accept such a document, and Asayi started arguing with no outcome.</p>
<p>Just then Asayi took out his wallet from the back pocket of his pants, a leather black wallet, filled with green notes,
my first thought this might be the semester fees, but it wasn't he took out a bundle of it and I knew he wasn't
paying his fees but was bribing the management to accept his fake documents. I believe the management to
not allow such behaviour I'm sure now they will punish Asayi for such a stunt, but to a shock they
accepted it, not only that, but they also accepted the form and allowed this person to next semester, I hate
people who accept bribe that too in an institute who is teaching that bribery is a crime. I will report this to the
government, not to the media. But it will never get out I'm sure of it. The world is so corrupt everyone is so
cruel, no one wants to follow the rules, and no one is disciplined. I am going to work day and night to sort this out
I am going to get a law degree and punish all these people no matter what their status is, they all will
be punished by me.</p>
<p>Snap out of it Jumal, you are not very good at law either, that's true said my inner voice, I was supposed to finish
my education this year, but I failed twice already and still has another year to complete, I am so determined to be
a lawyer but can't even get good marks in the most basic subjects. Why is it so hard to get marks? I'm good at
understanding criminal cases but not that good at explaining them. I try to solve cases that are pending with some
clues here and there I have derived solutions but what use if I can't even get good marks to pass and get a real judge
to judge them?</p>
<p>Another day is gone, and nothing is learned, only the frustration of people and the way the world is revolving around the sun
everyone wants to take shortcuts. Asayi bribing the management, the management accepting the fees, altering the
records, the government accepting illegal documents, the mayor himself building fake trails of success, and so on. The
world needs a cleansing, it needs a rule set, it needs someone who can tell exactly which person is doing good and
who is committing bad things. There should be a number system if the person does a good deed their level increases
just like my high score on the Pacman game in the Bard Arcade if a person does bad he loses his life. I'm a gamer too
but only for Pacman, this game drives me nuts when someone beats my score, so I spent way too much time on it
during nighttime. Currently, I have the highest score, and it is displayed on the board of the Arcade, Jumal #1 with
a score of 4500000, unbeaten for, 2 years.</p>
<p>One day, I'm going to finish my law degree and create cases to rule out all the criminals I have collected over the
years. I will make them guilty in court and the eyes of the law and make the world a good living place.</p>

<h2 id="devil-isnt-that-far"><a class="header" href="#devil-isnt-that-far">Devil isn't that far</a></h2>
<p>Boranth Corp. is the biggest and richest of all industries and firms on the planet but very few actually know about this
financially big organization whose whole responsibility is to keep society functioning by providing funds to
middle corporations and government agencies. I am the director member of the board and my only responsibility is
to handle people who work below me, I worked so hard for this my entire life, I studied hard and started working
at a very early age. I am Azreal, businessman. I am always in search of power full of my abilities. I handle
most of the infrastructure and banking facilities, every bank manager is my employee.</p>
<p>Today is just like any other day as I woke up at 4:00 am, and made myself a hot coffee. The sun hasn't risen yet, but some
buildings have lights turned on. My building is the only building in the vicinity with 50 floors that stood so high
that in rainy seasons I can see the clouds from my windows. All these small buildings around me are like peasants
to me, they stink and stay rotten, if even a single one could have dared and risked to become like me,
they could have escaped from the reality, they don't have the guts, they don't want to shed some blood.</p>
<p>I shed not a single drop but rivers, and lakes of blood on my way to the top, I don't care about meaningless lives
becoming obstacles in my way even if it is family, Yes, especially if it is family, cause when that happens the
world respects you more, the more they respect you the more they fear for their life. I can teach all these peasants
how to live under me, I shall conquer this business world, I do to some extent, but I want more.</p>
<p>My assistant messaged me that the Aus Deal is going to be arranged for the day, I got ready as usual driving my way
to the office, I was ready for anything thrown by the Aus manager Mr Saki, a white-bearded strong man, anyone
talking to him will lower his own voice to give this man the respect he thinks he deserves, but I know exactly
how to handle such kind of situations and I don't lower my voice not even if it means a loss for the company.</p>
<p>Mr Saki agreed to provide us with the infrastructure so that the next company building could be built. It is supposed
to build in the centre of Cardona city. But he had a condition, the condition was that the amount paid for the deal
should be double what is required. Half is the official amount for the deal and the other half is the commission.
Saki who had nothing to do with the deal and was just a middleman, wanted so much percentage of the commission is
bad for the deal and my company. I knew just then what I have to do so that Mr Saki gets us the deal and we don't have to
lose anything. I know the right medicine for this job. I have to take him down today!</p>
<p>The deal was done, I paid Mr Saki 5000M Dollars, of which half was paid by wire while the other half was paid
cash, it was clear as day that Saki was robbing us, but we have to get the deal done, and he is the only person who
can get this done. Mr Saki and I shared a bottle of rich whiskey, he laughed like a small child, and he told old stories
of how we planned to become a businessman. But he doesn't have any idea of what is about to come, what is about to happen
to the child-like laugh of his? No one is going to hear from him the next day. You will regret this meeting Saki, you
are going to pay for the loss with your useless life. So Saki left with a happy face, and  I can't wait to see his red
one in the newspapers.</p>
<p>I don't commit murder, I just order them, my assassin X is ordered to kill Mr Saki by a road accident so no one
suspects us, it will be just like a tragedy. Oh, poor Saki, you will pay for the loss you cause to the company. X will
not only put you down but will fetch all the money back, so you can lose only one thing, your life.</p>
<p>My secretary, Ash, a blonde with blue eyes, walked in, she was explaining to me, how Mr Saki dies in an accident, how the money
bag disappeared. and how this all can be bad for the deal. I was very happy with the results, and unknowingly I burst
saying he got what he deserves and of course, it was planned. The secretary was shocked her eyes wide open,
her face slowly turning pale, she was silent for a minute or more and burst out of the room apologizing for bringing
the news.</p>
<p>This was a mistake I can not let something like this small distract me from making a mistake in public, no one
should know about this. Even though I didn't say much, it did reveal my intentions and I can be found guilty.
Guilty of a murder which I technically did not commit, or did I? who cares. I could call her, tell her what I meant
or could let her know that I did but for a reason. That will be foolish, there's no going back. What if while she
travels home today by the train and accidentally falls on the tracks just when the train arrives, and her skull gets
crushed by the wheels of the train and the blood splatters around the station and everyone screams out loud, yeah
that will be a good scene!</p>
<p>I am back home, I usually watch some news before going to bed, and voilà, a woman falls on the track of Nasro Station
this evening at 7 pm, was it a suicide? was it an accident? no one knows. Isn't that exactly what I predicted this afternoon,
yes I did and in such details. Ha ha, the life of a human being is so fragile even a small decision can make you lose
your pathetic life. Life is just a meaningless joke which can end just by the smallest decision possible. Only<br />
god knows how long you live, or only I know how long you can live. I am the angel of death, Azreal! bow before me!</p>

<h2 id="tragic-accident-or-good-thing"><a class="header" href="#tragic-accident-or-good-thing">Tragic Accident or Good thing?</a></h2>
<p>I woke up early today even though it's Sunday, I have to go to the Arcade, some kid broke by a high score, he probably
slept in the arcade as well. I have to put up another big score, can't let anyone else take my place. I can't wait,
I will run there and get it sorted.</p>
<p>Today is different in some ways, the sky is clear and the sun is shining with full potential and I hate the heat, I am very
prone to strokes but haven't had one in a while. Sundays are movies day, I stay in my room the whole day watching movies,
tv series, and anime, and reading some novels. I am not that lazy but there is nothing else to do on Sundays, it is the
only day on my calendar which is empty with room for all fun things, and today it's empty for Pacman.</p>
<p>There is unusual walking traffic on the sideways, it's time to take a shortcut, there is only one shortcut right
under the bridge through the ways of the underground. I hardly travel underground, but I know it all I spent so much time
in the city that I know which road leads to what not only that, but I also know where are houses of some celebrities
and notorious business person. They have big houses, huge properties and fancy cars. I would like to get a car someday,
It would have been great if Pacman players would get paid. Yeah, that will be something.</p>
<p>The underground was just ahead, It was all sunny throughout the walk, I walked around the road and started climbing down
the set of stairs, the stairs are usually kept clean, and they were quite clean today. The stairs were wet I read the
sign and slowed down, but I lost control and couldn't stop, I won't stop, too late now going to fall and brake a bone for
sure. Someone save me!</p>
<p><em>&quot;Yes he fell right on his head!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Jumal how are you feeling? I hear this voice in my head, it is throbbing with pain, my head hurts like I just fall
down the stairs. Yes, I fell down that stairway, but it wasn't that deadly, I can't open my eyes. I have to try
harder. Where am I? Is this a hospital? I am in a hospital, this is the nurse, I have been unconscious for 15 hours.
The hospital informed my family but no one arrived, that's strange how can no one come to visit me?</p>
<p>I can't believe I fell from the stairs and ended up here, how am I going to pay for the bills, this is so bad, the nurse
is still here looking through the report, and it's multiple pages, what are these people cooking? I can tell them
I'm a law student they might not charge me extra. Wait a minute! Am I hallucinating? What is it that I'm seeing on the
nurse's head, is that a ... that can't be right.</p>
<p>I asked the nurse if I'm on any medicines, any stronger ones, and she replied saying I'm on morphine. Morphine is for pain
right, why would I be hallucinating? The doctor came in, and I see it, it is a number, a numerical figure right on
top of their heads like scores in a video game, and its red, and they are not solid but floating like animals. Am
Have I gone mad? This is not something ordinary, it's weird. The doctor asked me how I was doing and told me that I can
leave in the evening or tomorrow if I want to stay longer.</p>
<p>I don't care anymore if I stay here or go out, the only thing that is bothering me is this number on people's heads, it
was on the nurse's head and the doctor's and the other nurse's which came in the morning. Wait a minute, I need to see
a mirror, there is a bathroom, there should be a mirror. I walked inside the bathroom and there was a small mirror
enough to see my face. My head was bandaged tightly and a spot of blood where I probably hit myself in the head. I
raised my eyes to look just above my head, and I saw it.</p>
<p>I saw that I have nothing like what I saw in other people. I can't see it, where is my number, this is
weirder than seeing numbers on top of people's heads. Its cause of the bandage, maybe my number is stuck inside.
That's stupid, maybe these medicines did affect me, and now I am probably no more in the effect. I should go out and visit
other rooms to see if I still see it.</p>
<p>No matter whether I can see it now or not, it is fascinating that something like this happens, the number was like a score
no more like a level or could be years for how long they live. That's not possible if that was the year the doctor would be
living for 98 more years. And the nurse for 65 more years. Maybe it can be the total years, that's possible. But the average
life span is just around 60, these people must be lucky then. Let's not waste time here, just go home watch another movie,
and go to bed. I will beat my score next Sunday. Hopefully, the bill is not as big as my pocket.</p>
